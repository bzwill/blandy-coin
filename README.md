# blandy-coin
Factorio mod for multiplayer PVP

Blandy coin attempts to balance Multiplayer PVP more, and allow for some more interesting ways to interact with each other than combat.
The key balance mechanic is around restricting expansion by adding an additional cost.

Blandy coin add's a facility to allow you to generate credits, which are also now required to build 'expansion' like structures. These include power lines, transport belts, and railways.
